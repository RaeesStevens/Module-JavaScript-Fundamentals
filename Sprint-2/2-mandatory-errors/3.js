const cardNumber = 4533787178994213;
const last4Digits = String(cardNumber).slice(-4);

// The last4Digits variable should store the last 4 digits of cardNumber
// However, the code isn't working
// Before running the code, make and explain a prediction about why the code won't work
// Then run the code and see what error it gives.
// Consider: Why does it give this error? Is this what I predicted? If not, what's different?
// Then try updating the expression last4Digits is assigned to, in order to get the correct value

// Card Number is declared as a number and not a string, so slice won't work.
console.log(last4Digits);
// Yes this is what I predicted. The error is - cardNumber.slice is not a function.
// I used a template literal because it will automatically convert the number to a string before slicing.
